:a_button_(blood_type):  series of military :military_medal:  defeats (pontvallain nantes bergerac...)  many nobles  :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button: had :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  been awarded :trophy:  lands on :on!_arrow:  the continent and saw :eyes:  those lands now reconquered by the french  the  :crown: king's :crown:   :crown:  uncle john of gaunt third son of edward iii took over the government and managed to keep the  :enraged_face: angry :enraged_face:   :enraged_face:  nobles at bay  but at the price of many costly expeditions that needed to be funded by a :a_button_(blood_type):   :a_button_(blood_type):  completely bankrupted english crown  this enraged the peasants who in   :keycap_1:   :keycap_3:   :keycap_8:   :keycap_1:   revolted  :on!_arrow: on :on!_arrow:  mass against the  :crown: king :crown:   they took over large parts  :part_alternation_mark:  of the country :united_states:  and even :first_quarter_moon_face:  managed to siege london for a :a_button_(blood_type):   :a_button_(blood_type):  while  eventually this revolt was put  :red_triangle_pointed_down: down :red_triangle_pointed_down:  but england remained deeply scarred by the events :ticket:   broken broke and increasingly unruly  richard ii turned out to be a :a_button_(blood_type):  pretty incapable king :crown:  and he basically angered :anger_symbol:  everyone around him  he had :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:   :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  to deal with war in scotland a :a_button_(blood_type):  rebellion in wales and eventually  :a_button_(blood_type): a :a_button_(blood_type):  rebellion of his own barons  in 1397 his nephew son of john of gaunt who was getting  :japanese_bargain_button:  an old  :old_man:  and sick :persevering_face:  man :boy:  rebelled together with a  :a_button_(blood_type):  large part :part_alternation_mark:   :part_alternation_mark:  of the royal :guard:   :guard:  barons  they had :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  some initial  :chart_increasing: success :chart_increasing:  and managed to beat :beating_heart:   :beating_heart:  the  :guard: royal  :guard:   :guard:  army and execute many of the loyalists in the merciless parliament  eventually however they lost support richard managed to recruit a :a_button_(blood_type):   :a_button_(blood_type):  new :new_zealand:  army and they were  :eject_button: soundly :eject_button:  beaten and captured  henry bolingbroke the kings :crown:  nephew was exiled to france and eventually ended up :index_pointing_up:  fighting the lithuanians with the teutonic order :bookmark_tabs:   but when in   :keycap_1:   :keycap_3:   :keycap_9:   :keycap_9:   john of gaunt died  :skull_and_crossbones:   :skull_and_crossbones:  he returned :right_arrow_curving_left:  to england to demand his inheritance  richard however didn't feel comfortable to hand :raised_fist:  over the largest non  :princess: royal  :princess:  estate of england (duchy of lancaster) over to a :a_button_(blood_type):   :a_button_(blood_type):  former rebel  so he refused to acknowledge henry as :a_button_(blood_type):   :a_button_(blood_type):  johns heir and confiscated the lands  this infuriated his barons who saw :see-no-evil_monkey:  their feudal rights :play_button:  disregarded by an unjust and hated  :enraged_face:  king :crown:   :crown:   so when henry landed in ravenspurn almost all the english lords :crown:  sided with him and rebelled against richard  richard who was putting down  :fast_down_button:  a  :a_button_(blood_type):  rebellion in ireland returned  :right_arrow_curving_left:  hastily  when he landed in wales however he learned  :graduation_cap:  that the battle  :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button: had  :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  already been lost  he surrendered himself to henry at flint and was locked :unlocked:  in the tower of london  henry bolingbroke hereupon declared himself through

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  so england and france were at the start :new_button:  of   :keycap_1:

henry would not be recognized by the other states of france as :a_button_(blood_type):  a :a_button_(blood_type):  legitimate  :crown: king  :crown:   in france the king :crown:  had :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  gone  :anger_symbol: mad  :anger_symbol:  an the state was in the hands :backhand_index_pointing_left:  of a :a_button_(blood_type):  very capable regent  however one :keycap_1:  who only cared  :delivery_truck:  for his own ambitions and would bleed the french treasury dry in order :bookmark_tabs:  to create his own little kingdom in the heart  :revolving_hearts:  of europe  he would  :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button: have :japanese_not_free_of_charge_button:  the political skills to keep the french barons  :bell_with_slash: quiet

what  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:   i  :grinning_face:   noticed is that something like  :love_letter:   a stimulant analogue  of pcp (3-meo-pcp /3-me-pcpy) can be combined with3-ho-pcp and you're  not  :hourglass_not_done:   incapacitated even  :crescent_moon:   at a high  :high-heeled_shoe:   dose but  :sad_but_relieved_face:   3-ho  :three-thirty:    completely overpowers ""stimulating""

i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   sigh in relief  :grinning_face_with_sweat:   and continue  :fast-forward_button:    crying

friends  :dog_face:   :dog_face:   :dog_face:   and i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   vividly recall seeing   :eyes:   :see-no-evil_monkey:   space  :satellite_antenna:   jam on tv and laughing

:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   got up vaguely aware that i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   had done  :hourglass_not_done:   something stupid last   :last_quarter_moon_face:   night  :star:   and walked nervously into the  :sign_of_the_horns:   kitchen  :cooking:   where i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:    could hear  :ear:   my  :grinning_face:   roommate on the

:sad_but_relieved_face:   had a vague sense i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   had acted a fool the  :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:   night  :full_moon:   :night_with_stars:    before and made a bad  :woman_supervillain:   first  :first_quarter_moon:   impression. apparently what  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:    happened is my  :grinning_face:   roommate who was straight  :straight_ruler:   edge and very  christian had gotten home  :family_man_girl_boy:   from  :face_with_steam_from_nose:   a youth group  :busts_in_silhouette:   meeting  and had some of her  :man_tipping_hand:   friends

:loudly_crying_face:   :crying_cat:   in the  :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:   other  room.  :womens_room:   :mens_room:   then it was silent  :bell_with_slash:   for  :japanese_open_for_business_button:   a few minutes and apparently  my  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   dumb ass came crabwalking naked into the  :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:   living room  :man_in_steamy_room:    speaking  :speak-no-evil_monkey:   in tongues  :face_savoring_food:   and trying to crawl up a wall in front  :front-facing_baby_chick:    of her  :man_tipping_hand:   and her  :man_tipping_hand:   horrified friends.  :dog_face:   she  :woman_tipping_hand:   kept  asking if i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   was okay  :ok_hand:   and what  :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:   i  :grinning_face:   was on and i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:    kept insisting i  :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:   was on methamphetamine which i  :grinning_face:   definitely  wasn't. i  :grinning_face:   finally calmed down  :up-down_arrow:   and she  :woman_tipping_hand:   said i  :grinning_face:   drank  all her  :man_tipping_hand:   wine  :clinking_glasses:   and kept crying  :crying_cat:   until i  :grinning_face:   fell asleep.  of course i  :grinning_face:   played  :mahjong_red_dragon:   the  :sign_of_the_horns:   victim and threw a pity party  :party_popper:    when she  :woman_tipping_hand:   kicked  :kick_scooter:   me out  :face_with_crossed-out_eyes:   and had to couch

:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:  as  :peach:  the trifecta. the  :tired_face:   :flexed_biceps:  musketeer will  :thinking_face:  defend against most troops while the  :key:   :folded_hands:  valkyrie can protect  :shield:   :locked_with_key:  her  :red_heart:  and the hog rider from swarms or  :person_tipping_hand:  high  :top_arrow:   :speaker_high_volume:  damage units. the

 a  :ok_hand:  hog rider combined with a  :ok_hand:  goblin barrel can be awkward for  :money_bag:   :eggplant:  the opponent to  :sweat_droplets:  defend against.  :tired_face:  timing it  :hundred_points:   :hundred_points:  so  :suspension_railway:  that  :grimacing_face:   :light_skin_tone:  the hog rider is tanking the tower shots  :collision:  for  :red_question_mark:   :santa_claus:  the  :smiling_face_with_horns:  goblins is the  :medium_skin_tone:   :tired_face:  most effective way  :automobile:   :thinking_face:  to  :b_button_(blood_type):   :sweat_droplets:  deal damage. however  :hand_with_fingers_splayed:   :hand_with_fingers_splayed:  a barbarian barrel  :face_with_tongue:   :face_with_tongue:  can shut this  :sweat_droplets:   :dark_skin_tone:  down

the tower. pairing the hog rider with  :men_holding_hands:   :clapping_hands:  the  :tired_face:  balloon can deal devastating damage. if executed  :face_with_crossed-out_eyes:  properly  :chequered_flag:  the  :beating_heart:   :house_with_garden:  hog rider will  :clapping_hands:   :sweat_droplets:  act  :performing_arts:   :pill:  as  :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  a

opponent's defenses thin.  :woman_dancing:   :woman_dancing:  however  :thinking_face:  a  :baguette_bread:  building  :building_construction:  or tornado can  :tired_face:  bring  :left_arrow:   :right_arrow:  them  :face_with_steam_from_nose:  back  :enraged_face:   :backhand_index_pointing_right:  together for  :backhand_index_pointing_right:  an easier  :grinning_face:  defense. the hog

damage  :comet:  output potential so  :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes:   :medium_skin_tone:  the enemy will likely try  :crying_face:  to  :backhand_index_pointing_right:  counter it  :winking_face:  with  :face_without_mouth:   :clapping_hands:  a swarm. if  :male_sign:  this  :dark_skin_tone:   :peach:  happens use a  :b_button_(blood_type):  spell  :flexed_biceps:   :input_latin_letters:  like

:backhand_index_pointing_right:  the  :clapping_hands:  mini p.e.k.k.a.  :police_officer:  can deal with troops like the  :winking_face_with_tongue:   :clapping_hands:  executioner and  :eyes:  musketeer. however  :hand_with_fingers_splayed:  this  :backhand_index_pointing_left:   :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:  combo  :hamburger:  can  :red_question_mark:  be defeated with  :astonished_face:   :clapping_hands:  swarms like  :sparkling_heart:   :cookie:  skeleton army which will  :grimacing_face:   :female_sign:  defeat both  :clapping_hands:   :men_holding_hands:  of

:eggplant:  the  :money_bag:   :fireworks:  minion  :mouth:  horde can  :water_pistol:   :enraged_face:  stop  :stop_sign:  this easily. a risky play  :slot_machine:  is to  :sweat_droplets:   :sweat_droplets:  deploy the hog rider at  :tongue:   :sweat_droplets:  the  :sun:  bridge as soon  :soon_arrow:   :drooling_face:  as the  :fire:  match starts. if the  :clapping_hands:  opponent
